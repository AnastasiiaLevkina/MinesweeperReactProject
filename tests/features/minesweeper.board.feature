Feature: Minesweeper

            As a player:
            - I want to play to the classic minesweeper game
            - So I want to detect all the mines in the board

            How to refer to a cell:
            - Using the (row, column) nomenclature
            - Rows and columns starts from 1

            How to load mock data:
            - Using the <ctrl>+m keyboard combination to discover
            the load mock data form

            To define the board data will use:
            "o" No mine
            "*" Mine
            "-" Row separator

            Thera are two ways to define mock data:
            - Inline:
            "*-ooo-*oo"
            - Table:
            | * | * | * |
            | o | o | o |
            | * | o | o |

    To define the board display will use:
    COVERED CELLS
    "." Hidden cell
    "!" Cell tagged has mined cell by the user
    "?" Cell tagged has inconclusive cell by the user
    "x" Cell wrongly tagged has no mined cell by the user
    UNCOVERED CELLS
    "0" Empty cell
    "1" Clean cell with 1 adjacent mine
    "2" Clean cell with 2 adjacent mines
    "3" Clean cell with 3 adjacent mines
    "4" Clean cell with 4 adjacent mines
    "5" Clean cell with 5 adjacent mines
    "6" Clean cell with 6 adjacent mines
    "7" Clean cell with 7 adjacent mines
    "8" Clean cell with 8 adjacent mines
    "@" highlightedÂ mine
    "a" unhighlighted mine
